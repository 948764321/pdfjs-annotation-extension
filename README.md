## 1. Background

[PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) provides a [Viewer](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html) for online PDF preview and includes some basic annotation functionalities (FREETEXT, HIGHLIGHT, STAMP, INK).

In actual use cases, there is often a need for various annotation tools, leading to the idea of extending the viewer to add more annotation capabilities.

This project is based on `konva`, `react`, `antd`, and `web-highlighter`. It introduces additional annotation types by extending the existing `pdf.js` viewer without modifying its original code. These annotations can also be embedded in the PDF for printing and downloading, as shown below:

<div align="center">
  <img src="/examples/demo.gif" alt="demo" />
</div>

#### Multi-page Stamping

<div align="center">
  <img src="/examples/stamp.gif" alt="stamp demo" />
</div>

#### Mobile Version

<div align="center">
  <img src="/examples/mobile.gif" alt="mobile demo" />
</div>

For PDF Viewer users, this is a highly useful feature. If your requirement is simple annotation, the current features in the project should suffice. For more specific needs or requirements, you can further develop based on this extension.

## 2. Drawing Tools (Mobile Supported üì±)

1. Rectangle
2. Circle
3. Free Hand (grouped if drawn within a short time)
4. Free Highlight (with auto-correction)
5. Text (all inputted text is converted to images, which may sometimes result in unclear display)
6. Signature
7. Stamp (upload custom images, supports multi-page stamping)
8. Text Highlight
9. Text Strikeout
10. Text Underline
11. Annotation Selection (use `del` key or double-click to delete the selected object)

## 3. Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
 $ npm install or yarn
```

### Run in Development Mode

```bash
  $ npm run dev or yarn dev
```

### Run PDF.js Viewer

A DEMO example is provided in the repository (located in the examples folder). Navigate to ./examples/pdfjs-4.3.136-dist:

```bash
    $ miniserve or use another static server
```

Open the URL: http://localhost:8080/web/viewer.html to see the result.

## 4„ÄÅUsage

### Modify Output Directory

   The configuration can be found in the /configuration/environment.js file. By default, it points to examples/pdfjs-4.3.136-dist/web/pdfjs-annotation-extension. You can modify it to match your local pdfjs-dist directory to facilitate development:

```bash
    output: path.resolve(__dirname, '../examples/pdfjs-4.3.136-dist/web/pdfjs-annotation-extension'),
```

### Build

```bash
    $ npm run build or yarn build
```

Alternatively, you can directly download the release version.

### Integrating with PDF.js

Modify the pdfjs-dist/web/viewer.html file by adding a single line to include the generated extension file:

```html
    <script src="../build/pdf.mjs" type="module"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="viewer.css">
    <script src="viewer.mjs" type="module"></script>
    <!-- Insert the generated annotation extension file -->
    <script src="./pdfjs-annotation-extension/pdfjs-annotation-extension.js" type="module"></script>
    <!-- End -->
    </head>
```

## 5„ÄÅHow It Works

By leveraging the pdfjs EventBus, we capture page events and dynamically insert a Konva drawing layer. Shapes are drawn on the Konva layer, and the shape data is then converted into a format compatible with pdfjs annotationStorage, storing the annotations in annotationStorage. Although there are more annotation types, they are essentially mapped to the ones supported by pdfjs with some additional custom transformations.

For details about pdfjs annotation types, please refer to the documentation here üëá

## 6„ÄÅCompatibility

 Currently, this extension has been tested only with pdfjs-4.3.136-dist.
 **Note that it does not support drawing on rotated pages.**
